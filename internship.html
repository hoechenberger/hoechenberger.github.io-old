<h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
              <a href="images/Food_Brain.png" data-lity>
                  <img src="images/Food_Brain.png" alt="Food perception." style="float:right;width:150px;">
              </a>
              Taste is a principal component of the perception of food and food‐related stimuli. It helps us
              evaluate the edibility of a foodstuff (e.g., a bitter taste could indicate toxicity), and allows us to judge its
              nutritional value (e.g., sweet taste indicating carbohydrates). Taste perception is also tightly coupled with
              other mental concepts, such as hedonics (liking) and disgust, and clearly serves an evolutionary purpose. It
              therefore plays an integral role in the research of eating‐related disorders
              like binge eating, and is a potential key to a better understanding of the
              causes of obesity. However, the mechanisms of taste perception in
              humans are not well understood: Controlled taste stimulation in a
              laboratory environment is difficult, and only a very small number of
              research groups focus on taste for that reason. Furthermore, investigations
              mostly employ “pure” tastes only, while in real‐life situations, we usually
              encounter more or less complex mixtures of different tastes. We are one
              of the few research groups worldwide with the proficiency and equipment
              to conduct and analyze experiments employing pure tastes and taste
              mixtures to gain a better understanding of how, where, and when taste is being processed in the human
              brain. We use sophisticated computer‐controlled stimulation apparatuses and record brain activity via
              electroencephalography (EEG).
          </p>
              <h3>Your project</h3>
          <p>
              <a href="images/EEG.jpg" data-lity>
                  <img src="images/EEG.jpg" alt="Experimental setup during EEG study." style="float:right;width:150px;">
              </a>

              You will design, implement, conduct, and analyze
              a study on the perception and neural processing of taste
              mixtures in humans. You will learn how to come up with an
              experimental design; how to implement it in the lab, taking
              advantage of the equipment we provide; how to record data;
              and how to analyze these datasets. You can chose between two
              tracks: focusing your study on either psychophysical (adaptive
              thresholds) or EEG measures. You will be thoroughly guided
              through each of these steps to ensure your project will be a
              success.</p>

          <h3>Your opportunity</h3>
          <p>
              This project is a great fit if you are interested in cognitive neuroscience in general, and
              taste perception in particular. You should be eager to learn and apply new techniques that are required to
              conduct experiments in our lab. This includes programming (Python), acquiring a basic understanding of
              computer‐controlled stimulus delivery and how the involved apparatuses function and interact, as well as
              conducting basic statistical data analyses. This project will take three months to complete.
          </p>

          <h3>Psychophysiology of Food Perception Group</h3>
          <p>
              The group investigates the psychophysiological
              foundations of taste perception and the interaction of taste with other senses relevant to food perception
              and hedonic valuation (palatability) of food in humans. We offer a stimulating and collaborative research
              environment and excellent working conditions. The lab hosts a high‐density EEG system and state‐of‐the
              art taste stimulation systems suitable for EEG and behavioral studies. The institute is located in the
              metropolitan area of Berlin/Potsdam and allows access to a multitude of seminars, lectures and stimulating
              meetings at the surrounding institutes, e.g. Charité, Humboldt‐University, University of Potsdam, Technical
              University Berlin, etc.
